            <h1>Vedic Maths Addition Tricks</h1>
            <p>We have various tricks to perform the addition in Vedic maths. In this section, you will learn how to add numbers using one of the sutras called Ekadhikena Purvena with the help of an example.</p>
            <h3>Example :</h3>
            <p>Compute: 98765 + 63217 + 89522 + 60543
      
              <br>Or
              
              <br>By Sutra Ekadhikena Purvena, add 98765, 63217, 89522, and 60543.</p>
            <h3>Solution :</h3>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            <span>Write the given numbers in rows and columns by giving some space between the digits.</span>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            <span> Column I (from the right side), add the first two digits, 5 + 7 = 12</span>
            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            <span>Mark Ekadhika dot(.) on 1, (digit which is next to 7 in column II).</span>
            <h3>Step 4:</h3>
            <span>Now, start again adding with 2;<br>2 + 2 = 4<br>Again start with 4 such that 4 + 3 = 7</span>
            <h3>Step5 :</h3>
            <span>Write 7 below at the answer’s place</span><br>

            <h1>Vedic Maths Subtraction Tricks</h1>
            <p>Subtraction can be performed using 4 or 5 different methods in Vedic mathematics, and the best, as well as easiest way to subtract the numbers, is the Sutra Ekadhiken Purvena and Param Mitra Unka (the best friend). Here, two digits are called each other’s best friends if their sum is equal to 10. For example, 3 is the best friend of 7 since 3 + 7 = 10.</p>
            <h3>Example :</h3>
            <p>Subtract 389 from 746.
      
              <br>Or
              
              <br>By Sutra Ekadhikena Purvena, add 98765, 63217, 89522, and 60543.</p>
            <h3>Solution :</h3>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            <span> Write the given numbers in rows and columns by giving some space between the digits.</span>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            <span> Consider column I (from the right end), 9 is greater than 6 so we cannot subtract it from 6.<br>1 is the best friend of 9 and add 1 to 6, i.e. 1 + 6 = 7. So write 7 in the answer place and mark Ekadhika dot(.) on 8, which is in the same row of column II such that it becomes 9 (as 8 + 1 = 9).Here, dot(.) on the number represents one more than the previous number.</span>
            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            <span>Mark Ekadhika dot(.) on 1, (digit which is next to 7 in column II).</span><br>

            <h1>Vedic Maths Multiplication Tricks</h1>
            <p>Like addition and subtraction, multiplication can also be done using different sutras in Vedic maths. In this section, you will learn two simple methods of multiplying numbers along with examples.</p>
            <h3>Method 1:</h3>
            <p>In this method, we can multiply the numbers whose unit digits are added up to 10 or powers of 10.<br>

              Let’s have a look at the solved example given below to understand the multiplication of numbers.</p>
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>Multiply 63 and 67..</p>
              <h3>Solution:</h3>
              <p>63 × 67<br>Sum of unit digits = 3 + 7 = 10<br>Digits in tens places = 6<br>So, we can write the multiplication as:<br>63 × 67 = 6 × (6 + 1)/3 × 7<br>= 6 × 7/3 × 7<br>= 42/21<br>= 4221<br><br>We can also verify the result using normal mathematical calculations.
                This method of multiplication is referred to as the Sutra Ekadhiken Purvena. This method can also be used to multiply two numbers whose last two digits are added up to 100, the last three digits are added up to 1000. Also, in the case of mixed fractions, the sum of proper fractions must be added up to 1 to apply this method of multiplication.</p>
              <h3>Method 2:</h3>
              <span>If two numbers are to be multiplied and one of these numbers is having only 9’s then we can apply this method.</span>
              <h3>Example.</h3>
              <span>Multiply 876 and 999.</span>
              <h3>Solution.</h3>
              <span>Given, two numbers are 876 and 999.<br>Now, subtract 1 from 876.<br>876 – 1 = 875<br>Subtract 875 from 999.<br>999 – 875 = 124<br>Thus,<br>876 × 999 = 876 – 1/999 – 875<br>= 875/124<br>= 875124<br><br>This method of multiplying numbers is Sutra Ekanyunena Purvena.<br>Similarly, there are many sutras in Vedic maths to perform the multiplication of numbers.<br>To learn more interesting maths concepts, download BYJU’S – The Learning App today!</span>

                <h1>Vedic Maths Division Tricks</h1>
                <h3>Step1.</h3>
                <span>Identify how much short the divisor is to the power of 10.</span>
                <h3>Step2.</h3>
                <span>Split the dividend into 2 parts – Quotient and Remainder. The number of digits considered as the remainder is the same as the number of digits in the divisor.</span>
                <h3>Step3</h3>
                <span>Multiply the first digit of the quotient with the number obtained from step 1. Add this to the unit’s digit of the quotient part (from step 2).</span>
                <h3>Step4.</h3>
                <span>Multiply the number obtained from step 3 with the number from step 1. Add this number to the Remainder part (from step 2).</span>
                <h3>Step5.</h3>
                <span>Now, we check if the remainder is greater than or equal to the divisor. If yes, divide it again and add the new quotient part to the quotient (from step 2). The remainder obtained now is the final remainder.</span>
