            <p>The Cluster Innovation Centre - or CIC as it is popularly know - has been designed to seek and derive innovations from industrial clusters, village clusters, slum cluster and educational clusters. It is an endeavour to harness the passion and dedication of bright young minds with some of the major challenges of india and civil society.
